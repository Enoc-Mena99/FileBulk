# FileBulk
This is a file deletion program that asks you for an extension of a file (.mp3, .pdf, .docx, etc.) to delete all of the files in a dir that have that extension. 
Hope this helps make a lot of peoples lives easier....

# Example:
The program will show the user their current dir and ask them to input the directory where they have the bulk of files with the same extension they want to delete.
